Due to size limit, this folder only contains data samples. 
For full datasets, please refer to the separate data upload for the submission.
Also, the full datasets can be constructed using scripts under the `\preprocessing` folder.

Subfolder postfix of `syn_full` means the training data is augmented with synonyms (each as an entity). Alternatively, the corresponding folder *without* `syn_full` or with `syn_attr` contains training data having synonyms as an attribute for the entity.
