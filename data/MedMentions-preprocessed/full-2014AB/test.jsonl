{"context_left": "Wnt-5a / Frizzled9 receptor signaling through the G\u03b1o / G\u03b2\u03b3 complex regulates dendritic spine formation Wnt ligands play crucial roles in the development and regulation of synapse structure and function. Specifically, Wnt-5a acts as a secreted growth factor that regulates dendritic spine formation in rodent hippocampal neurons, resulting in postsynaptic development that promotes the clustering of the postsynaptic density protein-95 (PSD-95). Here, we focused on the early events occurring after the interaction between Wnt-5a and its Frizzled receptor at the neuronal cell surface. Additionally, we studied the role of heterotrimeric G proteins in Wnt-5a -dependent synaptic development. We report that Frizzled9 (FZD9), a Wnt receptor related to ", "mention": "Williams' syndrome", "context_right": ", is localized in the postsynaptic region, where it interacts with Wnt-5a. Functionally, FZD9 is required for the Wnt-5a -mediated increase in dendritic spine density. FZD9 forms a pre-coupled complex with G\u03b1o under basal conditions that dissociates after Wnt-5a stimulation. Accordingly, we found that G-protein inhibition abrogates Wnt-5a -dependent pathway in hippocampal neurons. In particular, the activation of G\u03b1o appears to be a key factor controlling the Wnt-5a - induced dendritic spine density. In addition, we found that G\u03b2\u03b3 is required for the Wnt-5a -mediated increase in cytosolic calcium levels and spinogenesis.

E2F-1 and CREB induced CD39 and CD73 expression, and were upregulated by adenosine and CGS21680. Adenosine triphosphate (ATP) hydrolysis and adenosine generation were inhibited by the knockdown of E2F-1 or CREB, and were accelerated in the presence of CGS21680. Based on these results, it can be inferred that adenosine, the adenosine A2A receptor agonist, E2F-1 and CREB are the possible factors contributing to the high expression of CD39 and CD73 on the Treg cell surface during sepsis. Adenosine and its A2A receptor agonist served as the signal transducer factors of the CD39 / CD73 / adenosine pathway, accelerating adenosine generation.

{"context_left": "Silent strain of caregiving: exploring the best predictors of distress in family carers of geriatric patients The aim of this article was to identify the best predictors of distress suffered by family carers (FCs) of geriatric patients. A cross-sectional study of 100 FC - geriatric patient dyads was conducted. The negative impact of care (NIoC) subscale of the COPE index was dichotomized to identify lower stress (score of \u226415 on the scale) and higher stress (score of \u226516 on the scale) exerted on FCs by the process of providing care.

The best combination of explanatory variables that provided the highest predictive powe r for distress among FCs in the multiple logistic regression (LR) model was determined according to statistical information criteria. The statistical robustness of the observed relationships and the discriminative power of the model were verified with the cross-validation method. The mean age of FCs was 57.2 (\u00b110.6) years, whereas that of geriatric patients was 81.7 (\u00b16.4) years. Despite the broad initial set of potential explanatory variables, only five predictors were jointly selected for the best statistical model. A higher level of distress was independently predicted by lower self-evaluation of health; worse self-appraisal of coping well as a caregiver; lower sense of general support; more hours of care per week; and the motor retardation of", "label_concept": "C0012634", "label": "Conceptually broad term referring primarily to physical illness.

We tested the hypothesis that this difficulty could in part be explained by discrepant quality-of-life assessments.

Direct effects of the microbiota on diarrheal pathogens include competing for nutrients and producing metabolites that inhibit pathogen growth or virulence. Indirect effects of the gut microbiota include promoting maintenance of the gut mucosal barrier and stimulating innate and adaptive immunity. Human epidemiological studies and experimental infections of laboratory animals both demonstrate that antibiotic treatment can alter the gut microbial community and thereby reduce colonization resistance against diarrheal pathogens.
